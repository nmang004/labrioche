## Proposal Template

### Subject Line Options:
- "Website Proposal for La Brioche - Modern Online Ordering Solution"
- "Transform La Brioche's Online Presence - Custom Website Proposal"

### üéØ IRRESISTIBLE EMAIL PROPOSAL TEMPLATE:

**Subject**: "La Brioche: Turn Your Bakery Into a 24/7 Revenue Machine (Special Pricing Inside)"

```
Hi [Client Name],

I've been thinking about La Brioche since our conversation, and I'm genuinely excited about what we could accomplish together.

**Here's what caught my attention:** Most bakeries lose 40% of potential customers because they can't order online. That's roughly $6,000/month walking out the door for a typical artisan bakery.

**THE SOLUTION (And Your Opportunity):**
I'm launching my specialized bakery website service, and La Brioche could be my flagship case study.

**SPECIAL LAUNCH PRICING (This Week Only):**
‚úÖ Growth Package: $3,500 (normally $5,500)
‚úÖ Payment plan: $1,400 ‚Üí $1,050 ‚Üí $1,050 (40% ‚Üí 30% ‚Üí 30%)  
‚úÖ FREE bonuses worth $900 (logo refresh, photography consult, etc.)
‚úÖ ROI GUARANTEE: 25% order increase or I work for free until you get it

**WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR BUSINESS:**
‚Üí Orders flow in 24/7 (even when you're closed)
‚Üí Staff spends time baking, not taking phone orders
‚Üí Professional online presence that matches your artisan quality
‚Üí Customer data for email marketing & loyalty programs

**THE MATH THAT MATTERS:**
- Average order increase: 25-30%
- Your break-even: 2.3 weeks (not months!)
- Year 1 additional revenue: $99,000+

**LIMITED TIME OFFER:**
I'm only taking 3 bakery projects at this special rate. La Brioche gets first priority if you're interested.

**ZERO RISK:** If you're not seeing results by month 2, I'll refund 50% and work for free until you do.

Ready to turn La Brioche into Norfolk's premier online bakery destination?

Reply with "YES" and let's schedule 20 minutes this week to make it happen.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. I've attached the full proposal with technical details, but honestly? The numbers above tell the whole story. This pays for itself in 3 weeks.

## Risk Management & Contingencies

### Common Client Objections & Responses

#### "We can get a website for $500 on Fiverr"
**Response**: "Absolutely, and that might work for a simple brochure site. However, for a bakery that needs online ordering, inventory management, and professional design, you need custom development. The difference is like buying a car vs. taking the bus - both get you there, but the experience and control are completely different."

#### "What if we don't like the design?"
**Response**: "Great question! That's why we include 2 rounds of revisions in the project. Before any coding begins, I'll show you detailed mockups for approval. We'll make sure you love the design before building it."

#### "How do we know it will increase business?"
**Response**: "Industry data shows that bakeries with online ordering see 15-25% increases in revenue. I'm so confident in this that I'm happy to provide references from my previous clients who've seen similar results."

### Project Risk Mitigation

1. **Scope Creep Prevention**:
   - Detailed written scope in contract
   - Change request process with hourly rates
   - Clear definition of "revisions" vs "new features"

2. **Technical Risks**:
   - Use proven tech stack (Next.js, Supabase)
   - Regular client check-ins
   - Staging environment for testing

3. **Payment Protection**:
   - Never more than 50% upfront
   - Milestone-based payments
   - Clear refund policy for non-delivery

---

## Contract Essentials

### Must-Have Contract Terms

1. **Scope Definition**: Detailed feature list
2. **Timeline**: Specific milestones with dates
3. **Payment Schedule**: 33/33/34% split
4. **Revision Policy**: 2 rounds included, $75/hour after
5. **Hosting Responsibility**: Client owns hosting accounts
6. **Content Responsibility**: Client provides text and images
7. **Launch Requirements**: Client approval required
8. **Support Period**: 30 days post-launch included
9. **IP Ownership**: Client owns final code
10. **Cancellation Policy**: Clear terms for both parties

### Red Flags to Avoid
